The Document 'Hands on IoT Lab v10' is a set of instructions to configure an MXChip device to send telemetry to a Remote Monitoring solution to be displayed on the dashboard.
The lab continues on to create a SQL PaaS instance, direct the telemetry to it and then create a PowerBI dashboard based on historical data and a live data stream.
Required: MXChip devices, Azure subscription (Azure Pass will work)

The lab is maintained and updated by the MTC in Thames Valley Park. Contact Jane Pitt (japitt) if you find any issues!
